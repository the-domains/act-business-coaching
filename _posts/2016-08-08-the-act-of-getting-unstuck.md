## The ACT of Getting Unstuck

The snow is falling and you seem to be getting along fine. Then it happens! You run into a bank of snow and get stuck. You are frustrated and are now faced with several choices. You can stomp on the gas with the hopes gaining traction and busting out. This causes your wheels to spin and the snow to melt under your tires. A sheet of ice quickly forms under your tires and halts your progress. You then decide to rock back and forth while moving your steering wheel in all different directions. This also compounds your problem. The rocking compresses the snow and creates an icy cradle in which each tire is nestled. Finding yourself without proper tools to get unstuck, you finally decide it is time to call for help.

Being stuck in business can feel like you are stuck in snow. When a business owner finds herself stuck, she often decides to keep pushing forward at full throttle. She finds her business wheels spinning as if on a sheet of ice. The hope of her business gaining that possible patch of traction, motivates her to keep her foot on the pedal. She waits eagerly to find that perfect product, employee, client, or marketing idea. Yet, nothing comes for her. Unclear and frustrated about her current path and lack of progress, she decides to change things up. She pushes on her brake, changes gears with some new ideas, and heads in a different direction. If that doesn't work, she then decides to go in yet another direction. Each time she hopes it will be the magic bullet to her problems. In the end, she finds herself still stuck, spinning her wheels, and rocking back and forth. She now wallows in her feelings of frustration and overwhelm. No matter what she does, her employees can't do the work like she can and sales aren't where they should be. She has created what feels like a sheet of ice under her business and she can't figure out how to get unstuck.

To get unstuck from snow the driver must first slow down and stop the vehicle. She needs to step out of the car and diagnose the problem. Sometimes the problem cannot be identified or solved without the proper help or tools. In this case, she must call for help. A plan can then be made and acted upon to remove any obstacles to getting unstuck. This may require a shovel to remove built up ice and snow, rock salt or sand for traction, and sometimes a tow rope and truck. To get a business unstuck, the owner must follow a similar pattern. The owner needs to stop and take a step away from the business to get a better perspective of the problem. In the business world, this may involve having a third party step in to help. They can help look at her situation from a different perspective and identify the tools that will benefit her the most. She then needs to A.C.T. to remove the problem. This involves Acknowledging the reality that the choices she now faces were created from choices she made in the past. Choosing to take responsibility for her contribution to the problems at hand. Then it is up to her to Transform her situation by utilizing her newly acquired tools and perspective to properly execute her plan to get unstuck.
